# Fulkerson Brewing Diary Website

## Jekyl
Read more about it [here](http://jekyllrb.com/).
To get started install Jekyl and run:
```
jekyll serve
```
Then go to the address shown in the termial.


## Updates guide
The information about each brew is stored in the `_brew` directory in markdown format.
If you change the files the website will be updated automatically (assuming you ran Jekyl).
Note the meta data at the top of the file.
Also, if you add new file it will appear on the main page.
Which very cool because it means we design the page once and then we just need to add markdown files for every new brew.

All images are stored in `imgs` and each brew will have its own directory.
